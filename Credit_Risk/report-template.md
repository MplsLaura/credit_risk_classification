# Module 20 Challenge Report 

## Overview of the Analysis

Analysis was done to evaluate the performance of a model based on loan risk. I used a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers. The data set included:

* Loan size
* Interest rate
* Borrower income
* Debt-to-income
* Number of accounts
* Derogatory marks
* Total debt
* Loan status

There are 77,537 records in the dataset. 75,036 have a healthy loan status and 2,500 have a high risk of defaulting.

* Explain the purpose of the analysis.
* Explain what financial information the data was on, and what you needed to predict.
* Provide basic information about the variables you were trying to predict (e.g., `value_counts`).
* Describe the stages of the machine learning process you went through as part of this analysis.
* Briefly touch on any methods you used (e.g., `LogisticRegression`, or any resampling method).

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
  * Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.



* Machine Learning Model 2:
  * Description of Model 2 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:
* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
